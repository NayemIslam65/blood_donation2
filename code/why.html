                        <p>Blood donation is important because maintaining an adequate blood supply in our community secures blood transfusions for patients. If you need blood one day, you would not hesitate to take it, so why would you hesitate to give it?</p>
                          <p>It saves lives, what else should we need to know for donating?

Sometimes it is not possible for you to give blood, or we may have to ask you to wait for a period of time before donating again. To save donors from wasted time and wasted journeys, this page addresses some of the most common questions about eligibility. </p>

<h2>Can I donate if I feel ill, have a chesty cough, a cold sore or am coming down with a cold?</h2>

<p>If you are feeling under the weather with any of these things it’s best that you wait until you feel better before you give blood.</p>

<h2>Can I donate blood if I am taking antibiotics or have an infection?</h2>

<p>You must be completely healed or recovered from any infection for at least 14 days before you give blood. If you are taking antibiotics you may need to wait a period of time after your last tablet.</p>

<h2>Can I donate if I am pregnant, or have recently been pregnant?</h2>

<p>During your pregnancy, you are not able to give blood. If you had a blood transfusion during your pregnancy or at delivery then you will not be able to become a blood donor.</p>

<h2>Can I give blood if I am receiving medical treatment or taking medication?</h2>

<p>We’ll need to check that you can donate. Whether or not you can donate will depend on the medication you are receiving as well as the condition for which you are being treated.</p>

<h2>Can I give blood if I have been to the dentist or received dental treatment?</h2>

<p>Simple fillings and check ups are usually ok after 24 hours. However, some treatments will mean a longer deferral. Please follow our advice about giving blood after dental treatment.</p>

<h2>Can I give blood if I have been travelling outside the Bangladesh?</h2>

<p>Travel to some parts of the world can affect your ability to donate blood.</p>

<h2>Can I give blood if I have a heart condition?</h2>

<p>We will need to have more information to know if you can give blood. It will depend on your specific heart condition.</p>



<h2>Can I give blood if I have had cancer?</h2>

<p>Our advice depends on the type of cancer.</p>

<h2>Can I give blood if I have had a transfusion, or received blood products or an organ transplant?</h2>

<p>We may need more information about your transfusion. Please follow our advice about giving blood after a transfusion. If you have received tissue or an organ, it may be possible to donate blood.</p>

<h2>Can I donate blood if I have high or low blood pressure?</h2>

<p>It is possible to donate blood if you have high blood pressure or low blood pressure. However, there are some restrictions. </p>

<h2>Can I give blood if I have had acupuncture?</h2>

<p>It may be possible to give blood after acupuncture. We will need to know the reason you had the treatment and the certification of the acupuncturist.</p>
